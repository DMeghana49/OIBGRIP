OASIS INFOBYTE INTERNSHIP

This internship was all about data science and analytics. I applied for this internship from the website of Oasis Infobyte. 
I completed all the given tasks by them. They have given 5 tasks.
The description of all the tasks is given below:

Task-1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
I predicted the species of IRIS Flower using the attributes given such as: petal length, sepal length, petal width and sepal width. 
I used Decision Tree classification(ID3 Classifier) for classification of species.

Task-2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS
I explored the dataset by creating various charts and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn libraries of python for unemployment analysis.

Task-4: EMAIL SPAM DETECTION

Task-5: SALES PREDICTION
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of 
people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist 
to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. The task of sales prediction with machine learning id done 
using python.I used linear regression model for forecasting the sales.
